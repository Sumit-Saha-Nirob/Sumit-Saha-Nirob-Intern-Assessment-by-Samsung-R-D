Designing watch faces is an art that blends creativity with technology. With Watch Face Studio, you can go beyond static designs and add interactivity using **Tag Expressions**. These expressions allow you to create dynamic, real-time effects by leveraging the watch's data, such as time, battery level, and user activity. In this blog, we’ll guide you step-by-step on how to create a watch face that displays battery levels dynamically—perfect for designers looking to craft engaging and functional watch faces.

## What Are Tag Expressions?
Tag Expressions are mathematical or logical formulas that dynamically control the behavior of watch face components based on live data. They are enclosed in square brackets `[ ]` and can be applied to properties like rotation, opacity, or position.

For example, to show an object only when the battery level is 50% or higher, you can use this expression:
```
[ba] >= 50 ? 100 : 0
```
This sets the opacity to 100% (visible) when the battery is 50% or more, and 0% (invisible) otherwise.

## Task Overview
In this tutorial, you will:
1. Create a watch face using analog hands and a dynamic battery level display.
2. Change the battery level color to red when it drops to 20% or below.
3. Use Tag Expressions to control visibility and appearance of components.

We’ll use a project from **Task 1** as an example. This project includes 10 battery level images that change dynamically based on the current battery percentage.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Project
1. Open **Watch Face Studio** and create a new project by selecting **“Analog Watch Face”**.
2. Name your project and set up the canvas with a **background image** that complements your watch face design.

## Step 2: Adding Analog Hands and Index
1. Add watch hands by selecting **Add Component > Hand** for the hour, minute, and second hands.
   - Customize the style, color, and alignment to fit your design.
2. Add an **index** by selecting **Add Component > Index**, and position it appropriately.

## Step 3: Preparing Battery Level Images
You’ll need 10 images representing battery levels from 0% to 100% in increments of 10%.
- Create or download these images, ensuring that the last two images (20% and 10%) have a **red color** to indicate low battery.
- Save these images in a folder for easy access.

## Step 4: Adding Battery Level Images as Layers
1. Click **Add Component > Image** and import all 10 battery images.
2. Place each image in the **center** of the watch face, ensuring proper alignment.
3. In the **Layers Panel**, stack the images in the order of their battery levels, from 100% at the top to 0% at the bottom.

## Step 5: Configuring the Battery Timeline
1. Open the **Battery Timeline**:
   - Select a battery level image layer, and navigate to the **Battery Timeline** in the Properties Panel.
2. Assign visibility ranges for each image:
   - For the 100% image: Set it to display when the battery percentage is between 90% and 100%.
   - For the 90% image: Set it to display from 80% to 89%.
   - Repeat this process for all images.
   - For the 20% and 10% images (red), set their visibility for battery levels **0% to 19%**.
3. Test the timeline to ensure only one image is visible for a given battery percentage.

## Step 6: Adding Tag Expressions for Color Change
To dynamically change the appearance based on battery level:
- Use the following **Tag Expression** for opacity:
``` 
[ba] > 20 ? 100 : 0
```
This ensures the opacity is 100% (visible) when the battery is above 20% and 0% (invisible) when it’s 20% or lower.

## Step 7: Testing Your Watch Face
1. Use the **Preview** mode in Watch Face Studio to test the battery level functionality.
2. Adjust any misalignments and verify that the red battery levels (20% and below) display correctly.

## Step 8: Exporting the Watch Face
Once satisfied, click **Build** to export your watch face project. Transfer it to a compatible smartwatch for real-world testing.

## Why Use Tag Expressions?
Tag Expressions bring your designs to life. By leveraging real-time data, you can:
- Create interactive watch faces that adapt to user behavior.
- Add functional features, like alerts for low battery levels.
- Offer a personalized and engaging user experience.

## Final Thoughts
Dynamic watch faces are the future of wearable technology, and Tag Expressions are the key to unlocking their potential. By following this guide, you’ve learned how to create a functional and visually appealing watch face that dynamically displays battery levels. We hope this inspires you to experiment further with Tag Expressions in your designs.

Happy designing!
